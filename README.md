# Names to Faces
This IOS app demonstrates `UICollectionView` and the photo library.

This is a fun, simple and useful project that will let you create an app to help store names of people you've met. If you're a frequent traveller, or perhaps just bad at putting names to faces, this project will be perfect for you.


## Main Targets
UICollectionViewController, UIImagePickerController, Data, CALayer, UIAlertController

## Credits
The concept of this app is adapted from Hacking with Swift book written by Paul Hudson.
